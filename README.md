Just learning how Atari 2600 is structured, and attempting to alter my assembler to work with it.

## ca65 vs DASM
The course I'm taking uses DASM, but I already have ca65 from NES stuff, and I didn't want to download another program

The file `atari2600.cfg` is adapted from the one in the [cc65 Wiki](https://wiki.cc65.org/doku.php?id=cc65:atari_2600)

#### _We'll see if it all works_ :grinning:
